Changing the system of production
=================================

By Jean Zin
-----------

The economic and financial crisis, serious as it may be, will not
provoke the end of capitalism which has weathered worse. But if an exit
from capitalism has begun, it is for other reasons, which are more
profound and more durable, and which are linked to our entry into the
digital era and immaterial labor. It is these new productive forces
which question the very basis of industrial capitalism, such as payment
for wage labor or exchange value.

It is for material reasons, connected to the reproduction of productive
forces, that the production system is forced to change radically, just
as it is for reasons connected to material reproduction that this system
will have to integrate ecological limits, by favoring the relocalisation
of the economy. If the exit from the society of wage labor has already
started, it is for the moment to our detriment, through the destruction
of welfare protections and the explosion of precariousness. Social
struggles will as always be necessary to conquer new rights and to
reorient this new system towards our emancipation and a more sustainable
economy. Nothing will happen by itself.

Es por razones materiales, conectadas a la reproducción de las fuerzas productivas, que el 
sistema productivo es forzado a cambiar radicalmenente, igualmente como es
por razones conectadas a la reproduccion material que este sistema tendrá que integrar
límites ecologicos, favoreciendo la relocalizacion de la economía. Si la 
salida de la sociedad del trabajo asalariado ya ha empezado, es por el momento
en nuestro detrimento, a través de la destrucción del Bienestar social
y la explosion de la precariedad. Las luchas sociales siempre serán necesarias
para conquistar nuevos derechos y para reorientar este nuevo systema hacia nuestra
emancipación y un economía más sustentable. Nada pasará por si mismo.

It is in any case within this material framework that our action can be
decisive, far from any utopia or value subjectivism. “New technologies”
occupy here a central place, comparable with the steam engine. However,
it’s not only the materialism of reproduction and of techniques which it
is necessary to take into account, but also the flows which constitute
production as a whole system. To abandon capitalist productivism and its
industrial model, neither isolated initiatives nor partial measures will
suffice; the new productive relationships and new arrangements must
operate as a system (of production, distribution, circulation) by
ensuring their reproduction.

Es dentro de este marco material que nuestra acción puede ser decisiva,
lejos de las utopias o "value subjetivism" (valor asignado por consenso?).
"Las Nuevas Tecnologías" ocupan un lugar central, comparable con el del motor
a vapòr. Sin embargo, no es solamente el materialismo de reproducción y de técnicas,
los cuales hay que tener en cuenta, sino que tambien los flujos que constituyen
a la produccion como todo un sistema. Para abandonar el productivismo capitalista
y su modelo industrial, ni iniciativas aisladas ni medidas parciales van a alcanzar;
las nuevas relaciónes productivas y los nuevos convenios deben funcionar como un
sistema (de producción, distribución y circulación) por medio de asegurar su reproducción.

What is a system of production?
-------------------------------

¿Qué es un sistema de producción?
---------------------------------


The systemic crisis concretely expresses everything that materially
connects us to the rest of the world, whether we like it or not.
Political economy itself was born from the inflation caused by the
influx of gold from the Americas at the end of XVIth century, as noted
at the time by Jean Bodin, demonstrating the influence of remote events
which are completely independent from us. Mercantilism initially tried
to respond to this kind of “natural catastrophy” by accumulating as much
precious metals as possible, but the intensification of world trade
which ensued was already reinforcing interdependencies. It was necessary
to wait until 1758 for Doctor Quesnay to show, with his “economic
table”, the analogy between economic circuits and the circulatory
system, connecting social classes and distant parts in a totality which
makes elements interdependent. Later, others attempted to reduce
economic flows to their thermodynamic equilibriuum (theories of balance
and of market self-regulation). To the contrary, one can consider that
Marx’s principal contribution will have been to show that production was
indeed organized as a system combining production, reproduction and
circulation, a system with its own dynamic (based on profit and
innovation), its specific relations of production (wage labor) adapted
to productive organization as well as to the stage of technical
development. Capitalism differentiated itself from feudalism as well as
from a predatory economy by being a mode of production determined by
circulation, industrial investment and waged work.

La crisis sistemica se expresa en todo lo que materialmente nos conecta con el 
resto del mundo, sea que nos guste o no.
La economía poilitica en si misma naci de la inflación causada por el influjo de 
oro desde "las Americas" al final del siglo XVI, como fue señalado en ese momento
por Jean Dodin, demostrando la influencia de eventos remotos que son completamente 
independientes de nosotros. El mercantilismo inicialmente intento responder a este tipo
de "catástrofe natural" acumulando la mayor cantidad de metales preciosos posibles, pero
la intensificación del comercio mundial que se produjo ya estaba reforzando las interdependencias.
Fue necesario esperar hasta 1758 al Doctor Quesnay para que muestre, con su "tabla económica",
la analogía entre circuitos económicos y el sistema circulatorio, conectando clases sociales
y miembros distantes en una totalidad que hace a los elementos interdependientes. Luego, otros
intentaron reducir los flujos economicos a su equilibrio termodinámico (teorias del equilibrio y
de la autoregulación del mercado). Al contrario, uno puede considerar que la principal contribución 
de Marx habría sido mostrar que la producción era de hecho organizada como un sistema, combinando
producción, reproducción y circulación, un sistema con su propia dinámica (basada en la ganancia
y la inovación), son relaciones de producción especificas (trabajo asalariado) adaptadas 
a organizaciones productivas, así como al nivel de desarrollo técnico. El capitalismo se diferenció 
del feudalismo, como de la economía predatoria, siendo un modo de producción determinado
por la circulación, inversiones industriales y el trabajo asalariado.

That production and reproduction inevitably compose a system does not
mean that there is only one system, albeit a dominant one! It is vital
to understand the fact that we belong to a plurality of systems,
effective totalities which determine us materially more than we
determine them, but in the gaps between which we can function. Indeed,
against the contemporary individualistic gospel, a system is defined by
the relatively independent operations of the elements which constitute
it. No isolated individuals can fail to be integrated into a system on
which they depend and which constrains them, like the transport system.
The concept applies beyond the realm of production, up to the ecosystems
exhibiting interdependencies between species and flows of matter, of
energy and of information which run through them. In his marvellous book
“The Macroscope”, Joel de Rosnay (1979) applied systems theory to the
economy as well as to the biosphere, leading to what he called an
ecosocialism. Thinking in a global manner does indeed means thinking in
terms of systems, circuits, flow, interdependencies, organisation,
division of functions, coordination, etc, where autonomy and
self-organization play in any case an irreplaceable role of adjustment.

The totalitarian tendency of markets, with their liberal theories which
do not recognize any value to non-commercial phenomena, has driven the
fact that we belong to different systems of production into the
background. However, it is a fact that there is no such thing as an
economy which is not a mixed economy, a plural economy, where at the
very least domestic, public and commercial exchanges coexist. This is
precisely what made it possible for capitalism to emerge from the free
cities on the margins of the feudal system, just like today a new
alternative system based on relocalistion should emerge.

What is important to understand is that it is useless to want to leave a
system of production if one is unable to propose a viable alternative
system. It is therefore crucial to be effective, and to not propose
simple correctives, even less to lecture people about the error of their
ways. We need new rules, new social relations, new modes of distribution
and exchanges which must not only connect together but also have an
internal dynamism and a synergy with the techniques employed. It is a
question of viability, of durability and of reproduction, where ecology
obviously becomes the central concern. These interdependences strongly
constrain what is feasible but are not sufficiently taken into account,
unfortunately, by those who want to change the system (it is not enough
to take control of it to change its operations), nor by those who simply
want to correct it with norms and laws.

Capitalism as productivism
--------------------------

Of course all systems are not equal, being distinguished by their means
and ends. However a system does not become dominant because of its good
intentions but because of its material effectiveness, of its capacities
of reproduction and expansion, according to a broadly Darwinian logic
(which should not be confused with a reductive Social Darwinism). What
made capitalism successful was its productivism which renders profit
dependent on the improvement of productivity resulting from to
investments and innovations, which in turn rely on technological and
scientific advances to lower the price of goods. This positive feedback
loop, a true snowball effect, lies at the root of the takeoff of
economies and of the “virtuous circle of growth”, a galloping
industrialization which must be paid a high price in terms of
inequalities, poverty and pollution.

The reasons for the success of an invasive organism or of an overly
voracious predator inevitably turns back against it when it has
colonized all the available living space. Though Africa remains to be
exploited, we can say that capitalism has reached its ecological limit
with globalisation, which does not leave it with an outside. The problem
is that it cannot stop its race towards growth. We can say that
capitalism initially imposed itself through its productivity but has
lasted thanks to the consumer society, which is of course ecologically
unsustainable. Material degrowth is thus unavoidable, but it is not
enough to declare this is the case, nor to exhibit voluntarism in the
reduction of our consumption and working time in order to hope to
significantly reduce a productivism which is at the core of a
growth-dependent capitalism. We really need to change the system! In
order to achieve this, we should not go backwards but instead take
advantage of the immaterial economy, which can help with material
degrowth, and especially to draw on the productive forces which enter in
contradiction with the very bases of capitalism.

Indeed, capitalism is first and foremost industry. Wage-labor is a kind
of temporary slavery (subordination) but the fact of paying work
according to time spent (machine time) is essential to separate workers
from their products and to appropriate the surplus value obtained by the
improvement of the productivity of capitalistic investments. However,
immaterial labour can be characterised by its non-linearity, as
production is not proportional to time spent. This is what opposes it to
physical labour, as information is opposed to energy. In the same way,
the more labour is skilled, incorporating training time, the less it is
reducible to immediate work, just like the work time of the virtuoso is
not confined to the concert. For all these reasons, the remuneration of
time spent becomes inapplicable (much as in the artistic field)
requiring a posterior assessment, based on results. This would seem to
result in the abolition of the separation between workers and their
products, which they could all the more claim their share of now that
they possess their own means of production with their personal
computers. Except that it is very difficult to evaluate the contribution
of everyone in performances which are mainly global and collective. So,
not only does wage labour measured against working time become
completely inappropriate in the age of information, being progressively
replaced by project contracts and outsourcing, but it is the measure of
value itself which becomes problematic (people speak of a “crisis of
measure”). The commodity therefore loses its status of exchange value to
the benefit of a pure opportunity value (or of prestige, of brand, or
speculation), which is often quite ephemeral and which has only a
distant connection to its reproduction value (except perhaps when it is
on sale).

“As soon as work, in its immediate form, has ceased to be the main
source of wealth, working time ceases and must cease to be its measure,
and exchange value thus ceases also to be the measure of use value.”
(Marx, Grundisse II, pp. 220-221).

Changing eras
-------------

It is not only capitalism’s industrial bases that are weakened, digital
costlessness directly attacks intellectual property rights, its infinite
capacity for reproduction providing immediate access to all works, an
access that no-one will want to give up. This endangers cultural
industries (and they certainly complain enough about it) who will need
to reinvent themselves. It is on these grounds that one finds the
strongest opposition of digital culture to the capitalistic logic, to
old media, to music and movie corporations. The issue of downloading
divides the generations and unleashes freedom-killing reactions which
oppose themselves to technical reproduction capacities inherent to
digitisation and networks! The end of the industrial model does
represent the end of the system of capitalist production, of wage labour
and of the commodification of culture and life. Of course, for the
moment, in the absence of another system more suited to immaterial
production, this contradiction of the new productive forces and of
former relations of production is translated into additional and
ever-more unbearable stress borne by an ever-increasing share of
employees, with the rise of precariousness and the regression of
welfare. For the moment the old system is trying to maintain itself
through untenable laws that attempt to match technological innovation by
fiercely maintaining obsolete property rights. These are contradictions
on which it is possible to rely; productive forces that can be mobilised
to build a new system of production.

Make no mistake, neither the crisis, nor the ecological limits, nor our
good intentions, will be enough to overcome capitalism, but only digital
technologies, now at the heart of production, as well as the immaterial
labor that pushes the reorientation of the economy towards human
development. This does not mean that things will happen by themselves,
nor necessarily to our advantage if we do not vigorously defend our
rights, but it is what conjures and enables a new system of production
with new relations of production. Admitting the central place of
digitality therefore assumes a crucial importance in the determination
of a strategy for a future-oriented political ecology in the age of
information.

If digital technologies were not sustainable, as some environmentalists
contend, this would not imply their disappearance but would only reserve
them to an elite as well as to production processes. However, it seems
rather that these technologies are spreading at an until-now unheard-of
speed, including in the poorest countries which have little
infrastructure. It is all the more urgent to reduce their consumption
and to make them more sustainable because it is certain that we cannot
continue on the current slope, nor rely on the market to take into
account environmental issues that most of the time translate into an
increase in costs (there is no energy shortage, the problem is that
fossil fuels, oil and coal, are too abundant and their prices were too
low so far, thus constituting an obstacle to renewable energy).

Even if the battle is not won in advance, there is nothing here that
seems out of reach, as digitality is one of the essential bases of
ecological consciousness and global regulation. In addition
dematerialisation can make a decisive contribution to a necessary
material degrowth in many areas. Thus, we know that digital networks can
facilitate relocalisation thanks to their capacity for decentralisation,
which have long been implemented in corporations. No future ecology can
do without, which implies caring about their sustainability, reducing
waste and guiding them towards energy efficiency.

Creating a system
-----------------

We have evoked most of the elements of a surpassing of capitalism in the
era of information, ecology and human development: the new relocalised
and immaterial production system will primarily have “to be a system”
and adapt to the new productive forces, to new technologies as well as
to the material constraints of reproduction and thus to environmental
constraints. This has nothing to do with moral or even purely political
approaches proposing laws and norms, which are indeed often necessary.
We must insist on the fact that we need to go back to causes and not
only worry about the most conspicuous effects. This means that we must
address the question on the side of production more than on that of
consumption, on the side of the system more than on that of the
individual, on the side of offer more than on that of demand, on the
side of the quality of the work more than on that of the quantity
produced. We need to convince ourselves that the simple degrowth of
waste and of commodification cannot change the productivist logic of
capitalism, any more than the reduction of working time. Leaving
productivism means first leaving the waged society dependent on
consumption and on a profit-driven capitalist production.

It is not enough to declare something or to take one’s desires for
reality, but it is vital to get the context right and to understand the
stakes, which have only been sketched here. These stakes already
strongly constrain an exit from capitalism which has already started but
is still far from constituting an alternative. We must start from what
is, from the “actual movement which abolishes the current state of
things”, from ongoing experiments, which should be constituted as a
complete and operational production system to become a real alternative.
No isolated initiative or partial measure can replace this.

André Gorz was probably the first to present a coherent representation
of a new relocalised system of production in the era of information,
ecology and human development, by gathering in “Misère du présent”
(1997) the various initiatives and proposals where the seeds of the
future could be perceived. In fact, these proposals had already been
defended for some time by Jacques Robin and the Transversales journal,
without being quite connected together. They were replaced in the early
1990s by the reduction of working time (“réduction du temps de travail”
or RTT), a strategy that would show its limits with the establishment of
the 35h working week which increased wage flexibility.[1] Not only was
André Gorz one of the main theorists of RTT but he was firmly opposed to
the guaranteed wage, which was a rising claim in social movements
despite its apparently utopian nature. The category of “third sector”
was also ambiguous, and “plural currencies” a little too fuzzy. Yet by
bringing together and defining these mechanisms (guaranteed income,
local currency, self-managed workers unions), André Gorz allowed a great
step forward to be made, not so much in terms of the alternative’s
credibility (these measures still seem too exotic and minuscule in
relation to the immensity of the task) but rather for his success in the
constitution of a new articulation between production, distribution, and
exchanges. I have done little more than focus on the systemic coherence
and combine these mechanisms with the libertarian municipalism of
Bookchin – though it is far from a detail to anchor relocalisation in
municipal democracy.

The most difficult to admit remains the fact that there are only local
alternatives to globalised commerce. However, by definition, there can
only be relocalisation at the local level, and thus we can start right
away, even if these actions only makes sense inasmuch as they are
integrated into alternative circuits and a Global Justice perspective.

It is impossible to describe in detail this post-capitalism which
refutes too-simple solutions such as nationalisation of the economy or
the collective ownership of means of production, leaving relations of
production and the productivism of the system unchanged. To repeat, none
of the isolated measures are determining in itself, only their
combination is. It is indeed at all levels that the potentialities of
digitality must be put to use, that small circuits need to be favoured
and the rules of the game changed in international exchanges (fair
trade, alternative circuits), in national redistribution systems and in
local life. The point really is to change the world in its totality and
to build a new system of production, but contrary to totalitarian
utopias, there can be no question of abolishing the plurality of systems
and lifestyles. It is necessary to fight against authoritarian policies,
and all kinds of green fascisms, in order to defend our autonomy and to
continue the fight for our emancipation. We locate ourselves in a plural
and free economy, where capitalism will thus not disappear any more than
industry but should employ less and less wage earners in an increasingly
automated and relocalised production.

The point is to extract the maximum number of workers from dependency on
profit-oriented production as well as alienated work (without claiming
to abolish all alienation). Rather than everyone becoming civil
servants, the point is to give to everyone the means of autonomy and of
choosing their life (including a more natural life), replacing a good
share of commercial leisure by self-developing activity; this should as
a consequence radically modify consumption, without feedback effects
(contrarily to the strategies aiming to reduce consumption). The point
is to leave behind waged work in favour of autonomous work, immaterial
work, chosen work, which does not only mean supporting digital
creativity but also local services, artistic activities, and even
revitalising crafts and small-scale subsistence agriculture. For that
one needs at the same time a guaranteed income, which allows autonomous
work, municipal co-operatives to practise an activity and be associated
with other autonomous workers, and finally local currencies to ensure
more outlets to local production without closing oneself to the outside.

The least one can say is that all these concepts are neither familiar
nor credible, being a thousand miles from ordinary representations and
even unacceptable ideologically for the majority, which does not prevent
them from materially imposing themselves all over the world. In any
case, new relations of production which create a system and are adapted
to the digital era do represent the condition for a less productivist
relocalised economy. This is the framework in which our future should be
conceived. This does not mean that this would be enough to resolve all
problems! Numerous measures are necessary to regulate capitalism, make
agriculture more sustainable and cities more livable, but without
falling into techno-utopianism, we should make sure our understanding of
our era and our goals are accurate. So, whether we like it or not, it
will be necessary to make use of the potentialities of telework, of
teleconferences, of teleshopping and even of 3D printers (or perhaps of
future digital personal fabricator) which can not only stimulate
personal creativity but especially facilitate the obtaining of spare
parts for repairs, or of any other small object, by eliminating material
transport. This will undoubtedly not save us, it’s only a small portion
of the solution, but we will need to accept it (like eating less red
meat) and without forcing anybody!

None of the instruments in our possession can be neglected but what
needs to be insisted on, is on the need for a systemic approach and a
general coherence. We need a global approach taking into account all the
dimensions of our life. Our capacity to make a correct diagnosis and to
come up with the right answers will be more crucial than our good
intentions. If it is necessary to fight for an emancipating ecology, the
room for maneuver is indeed very weak, even if it still exists, between
technical, ecological and systemic constraints. In any case, these
modest instruments could prove rather quickly extremely useful if the
monetary system breaks down, but the good news is that the municipal
character of the bases of this new system of production allows its
advantages to be tested immediately, here and now, as long as local
conditions lend themselves to it.
